### About Me
Hi! 👋 I'm Ruta, a Junior Data Scientist at ADV Tech. With over a year of experience in data science, I specialize in machine learning, data analysis, and deploying ideas into production-ready solutions. 🚀  

### My Projects

#### **Predicting Heart Disease 🫀**
In my personal project, I analyzed the famous **Framingham Heart Study** dataset to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD). This project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and deployment.  

#### **Kinopoisk Telegram Bot 🎥**
I developed a Telegram bot that interacts with the **Kinopoisk API**, providing users with convenient access to movie and TV series information. The bot is designed to retrieve detailed data, including ratings, descriptions etc. for cinema enthusiasts.  

### Tools & Tech  
- **Programming Languages & Libraries**: Python 🐍, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna  
- **Frameworks & Deployment**: Streamlit, FastAPI, Docker  
- **Automation & APIs**: Telegram Bot API, Kinopoisk API
